This frontend is a React + Vite scaffold for the TFTP assignment platform.

How to run:

1. Install dependencies (node.js required):
   npm install

2. Start dev server:
   npm run dev

This scaffold includes pages for:
- Login / Register
- Student dashboard
- Teacher dashboard
- Assignment view and submission

Currently these call placeholder endpoints at /api/; connect to the Flask backend later.
